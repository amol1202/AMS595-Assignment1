\section{Introduction}
Monte Carlo methods are widely used for numerical integration and estimation tasks. In this report, I work on demonstrating the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of $\pi$. This report includes conducting experiments using a fixed number of points, achieve a specified precision, and visualize the results with an iterative process that generates a simulation. The relationship between computational cost and precision is also analyzed.

\section{Monte Carlo Estimation with Fixed Number of Points}
\subsection{Methodology}
Estimating the value of $\pi$ can be done by randomly generating points inside a unit square and counting how many fall within a quarter circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points gives an estimate for $\pi$:
\[
\pi \approx 4 \times \frac{\text{Number of points inside quarter circle}}{\text{Total number of points}}.
\]
I have used increasing values for the number of random points: $10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7$.

\subsection{Results}
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Estimated value of $\pi$ versus number of points (log scale).}
    \label{fig:pi_estimation}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pi_estimation}, the estimated value of $\pi$ approaches the true value as the number of points increases. The horizontal red dashed line represents the true value of $\pi$.

    \caption{Deviation of estimated $\pi$ from the true value.}
    \label{fig:pi_deviation}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pi_deviation} shows how the deviation from the true value of $\pi$ decreases as more points are sampled, indicating that the method converges.

\subsection{Execution Time}
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{execution_time_plot.png}
    \caption{Execution time versus number of points (log scale).}
    \label{fig:execution_time}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:execution_time}, the execution time increases with the number of points. Larger datasets require more computational effort, which is reflected in the growing time complexity.

\subsection{Precision vs Computational Cost}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{precision_vs_cost_plot.png}
    \caption{Precision versus computational cost (execution time).}
    \label{fig:precision_cost}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:precision_cost} shows the trade-off between computational cost (execution time) and precision. As the number of points increases, precision improves but at a higher computational cost.

\section{Monte Carlo Estimation to a Specified Precision}
\subsection{Methodology}
In the second part of the experiment, the aim is to achieve a target precision (e.g., 0.001). The algorithm iteratively increases the number of random points until the deviation between successive estimates of $\pi$ falls below the specified precision threshold. The loop terminates when the target precision is met or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.

\subsection{Results}
The final estimate of $\pi$ for a precision target of $0.001$ was obtained after several iterations. A total of $N$ points were used, and the number of iterations was $X$.

    \label{fig:precision_estimation}
\end{figure}

\section{Monte Carlo Estimation with Simulation}
\subsection{Methodology}
In the third part, a function was created to estimate $\pi$ to a specified precision while generating a GIF that visualizes the points inside and outside the quarter circle. This process allows for real-time visualization of the convergence of the estimate.

\subsection{Results}
The output is a GIF file showing the iterative process of random point generation and the final estimated value of $\pi$.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
The Monte Carlo method provides an intuitive and relatively simple approach to estimate $\pi$. However, achieving high precision requires a significant number of points, and thus greater computational cost. The trade-off between precision and execution time should be considered when selecting the number of points. The visualization through a simulation allows for real-time observation of the convergence of the estimate.
