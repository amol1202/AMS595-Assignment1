# Estimating π using Monte Carlo Method

We use the fact that the ratio of the area of a quarter circle to the area of the unit square in which it is inscribed can be used to estimate π. To setup the solution, we consider a unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). The quarter circle of unit radius is centered at (0,0).
